Exercise 1
Re-write the following script as a list comprehension:
list_a = ['apples', 'oranges', 'apricots', 'bannanas', 5, 12, 'pineapples']
list_b = []
for ele in list_a:
    if type(ele) == type(10):
        if ele / 2 == 6:
            list_b.append(ele/3)

Exercise 2
Write a script that asks the user to input anything and outputs on your terminal only the numeric values.
For example
User input: 4hssi80 293 $@19ksfa;s
Output should be: 48029319

Exercise 3
Write three lambda functions using one, two, and three arguments, respectively.

Exercise 4
Use map to trim off the junk information from the collection in the following list. Junk information ends with '#'. 
Output the trimmed sequences on your terminal.
list_col = ['4_uo#gtagcga', 'i89!!#ctgcag', '|..p++-#atgtaaagct', 'qe342#attgatcgag']
For example
If the sequence is: ~492yu_9338*#ttagttagcctagca
The trimmed sequence should be: ttagttagcctagca

Exercise 5
Use filter to collect all numbers that are divisible by three in the following list. Then sort the numbers in descending order.
Output the list on your terminal.
a = [1, 2, 3, 15, 17, 19, 21, 34, 42]
