Exercise 1
Output the following DNA fragments as one contiguous sequence on your terminal using variables.
DNA fragments: AGTCCACC, AAAA, GCGC, AGTGGCAGAC, TAA

Exercise 2
Take the following 'corrupted' DNA sequence and 'fix it'. Output the 'fixed' sequence on your terminal.
Corrupted DNA sequence: aGccAgTg153aaWQQD45GctATGcaTA
Hint 1: Use string slicing
Hint 2: The 'fixed' sequence should look something like: ATGCAGTGGACCAAGACA

Exercise 3
There is an unique amino acid motif, WWCYC, which is important in the function of peptide X.
Output the starting and ending positions of the motif on your terminal.
Peptide X: MYKLIHMLNWNWWLAIEQQALAWWCYCWVMNNDEKCYWPIIYQDDNMLAWLQNQKKLICCITATL
Hint 1: Try to write the script in 2 lines (not including the initial Peptide X variable assignment)
Hint 2: The str() function converts int to str objects

Exercise 4
Write a script that creates 'mini' forward and reverse primers for the following DNA sequence. 
The primers should be ten base pairs in length. Output the primers on your terminal from the 5' to 3' direction.
DNA sequence: AGCTCCGGACGTAGCGACTTAAGGGCCTTATATCACGAAAGTTTCGACTAATGCAGGGATCTAG
Hint 1: Negative numbers are used to count backwards in string slicing 
For example, -1 denotes the last letter in a string of letters
Hint 2: str[::-1] reverses a string
Hint 3: Strings are case-sensitive

Exercise 5
Write a script that calculates the GC content for any DNA sequence. Output the percentage on your terminal.
