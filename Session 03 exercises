Exercise 1
Write a script that outputs the word 'positive' on your terminal if a DNA sequence begins with ATGCCC and 'negative' if not.

Exercise 2
Splice out the introns and join together the exons. Output the contig on your terminal if it's greater than or equal to 40 bases.
Pre-mRNA: GCGACTAGCAGATCCGCATGCAGCAGACGATTTCGACAGTGACGCGATTAGGCAAAAAAAAAA
Intron 1: ATCCGCA
Intron 2: AGACGAT
Hint: Use string slicing

Exercise 3
Write a script that either outputs the number of W and Y residues or A and T bases - depending on the input.
Input 1: CCDLKIGSWLLWYYDEEKHIISWYWE
Input 2: AGTCGATGCAGACTGAGACATGCAAGC
Hint: Use one if/else block

Exercise 4
Write a script that sorts varying temperatures. It outputs 'boiling' if it's 100C or higher, 'high' if it's 40-99C, 'medium' 
if it's 15-39C, 'low' if it's 1-14C, and 'freezing' if it's 0C or below.

Exercise 5
Write a nested script. Anything is okay - be creative!
