Exercise 1
Output on your terminal the most nested element(s).
list_a = ['agc', ['biological', 'polymers', ('extracted', [11, 54])], 'tcag', 'ccctg']

Exercise 2
Print out on your terminal a list of unique elements in descending order based on the values in the two dictionaries.
b = [{'col_1':[45,2,6,12,94,31,16,87,93,10]}, {'col_2':[78,10,88,91,6,32,5,16,17,52,42]}]
Hint 1: Lists can be added to one another
Hint 2: Remember sets

Exercise 3
Open the text document 'S07_exercise_3.txt' and parse it. Each line is a short sequence of three nucleotides. 
Output on your terminal a histogram indicating the number of nucleotide in descending order.
For example:
aca 18
taa 15
ccc 9
atg 2
