Exercise 1
Output a text file with five total lines. The lines can contain anything.

Exercise 2
Parse each line in the file you created and add '_ID.W' to the end of each line, and output each line into a new text file.
For example:
original line: test_string
line in new file: test_string_ID.W

Exercise 3
Take a look at 'S05_exercise_3.csv' under 'Exercises related'. It is a comma-seperated text file that contains 300 RNA-seq reads 
exported from Geneious Prime. Each line contains the sequence ID followed by the sequence itself, seperated by a comma.
Parse the file and output each sequence on your terminal. Do not output the ID.

Exercise 4
Using the same file, this time output the complement of each sequence on your terminal. Do not use the string method replace().
Hint 1: Remember loops and conditionals can be nested and strings are iterable objects.
Hint 2: If the nucleotide base is N (ambiguous) its complement is N as well

Exercise 5
Re-write your script in exercise 4 incorporating one or more custom functions.
