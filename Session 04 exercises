Exercise 1
Write a script that asks the user to enter their birth month (number value) and outputs on the terminal whether they were born 
on an even or odd month.
Example output: You were born on an 'even' month!

Exercise 2
Write a function that converts Farenheit to Celsius. Output the temperature on your terminal.
Do not hard-code the temperature input.

Exercise 3
Write a function that calculates the GC content of any nucleotide sequence. Output the GC content on your terminal.
Do not hard-code the sequence input.

Exercise 4
Write a function that concatenates any three strings. Output the string on your terminal.
Do not hard-code the inputs.

Exercise 5
Write a script that tells you whether a DNA sequence is short, medium, or long in length. 
And if the GC-content is 60% or greater, it also tells you the sequence is GC rich. Output on your terminal. 
Do not hard-code the input.
Use the following criteria:
long sequence - greater than or equal to 25 base pairs
medium sequence - greater than or equal to 12 base pairs
short sequence - greater than or equal to 1 base pair
Hint: invoke the function you used for Exercise 3
