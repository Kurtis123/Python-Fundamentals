Exercise 1
Import the math module and calculate the square root of pi.

Exercise 2
Use regex to extract the the poly-basic tract in the following two sequences. Output the extracted sequences on your terminal.
seq1 = 'MDCLLIMGGIDGGHYDGGKKKKKEEKKEEEEKKGGIL'
seq2 = 'MLIYYGAAIGEEKKEEKKKKEEEEEK'

Exercise 3
Take a look at 'S08_exercise_3.txt'. Each line has information seperated by '/'. However, the order has been randomized. 
Write a script that outputs each ID into a new text file. Each ID is made of three alphanumeric characters followed by a dash
followed by one to three numbers. The entire ID is nested within two asterisks.
Hint: The new text file should look like
T68-1
5RU-32
Y1L-4
etc...

Exercise 4
Each line in 'S08_exercise_3.txt' represents a sample collection. Phentoypes are described as either 'clear', 'cloudy', or 'opaque'. 
Write a script that outputs a histogram representing the total number of phenotypes on your terminal in descending order.
Hint: The output should look like
clear 34
cloudy 21
opaque 6

Exercise 5
Write a script that asks the user to input two integers. The terminal output tells whether the first integer is divisible 
by the second integer.
